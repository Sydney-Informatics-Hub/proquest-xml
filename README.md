# ProQuest XML reader

Python code for reading the XML files that ProQuest provides
in TDM studio.

## Installation

The package can be installed directly from GitHub using
`pip`:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/proquest-xml.git@master
```

If installation isn't possible, the `parser.py` module
currently contains all the most important code,
so you can download it and use it as a standalone module.

## Usage

See the
[pq_xml_example.ipynb notebook](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/proquest-xml/blob/master/pq_xml_example.ipynb)
for examples of how to use the package.
